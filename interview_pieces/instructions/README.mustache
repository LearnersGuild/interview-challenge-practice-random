# Foundations -> Practice Challenge

## Introduction

This document contains the requirements for completing your interview challenge as well as instructions for setup and teardown. Read the following content carefully!

### Setup

First, we'll need to navigate to the directory on the interview USB drive where the challenge files are. On a mac, you'll find it here:

```sh
cd "{{{ outputDir }}}"
```

Next, we need to setup the challenge. You can do so by simply running a script:

```sh
cd setup && npm run setup && cd ..
```
